  ### Iteration 1

  We were planning on completing the 5 features below, but unfortunately the "Categories" feature is still in progress, since we came across some issues during the creation of our SQLite Database. However, we managed to balance that, by implementing another feature which was not planned and whose effort and priority values are the same: the "Reset Data" feature.
